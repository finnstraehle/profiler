  <p>Profiler is a technical project created in the "Coding Introduction" course at HSG University, utilizing Ruby on Rails. It's a web application designed for managing CVs, Cover Letters, and job applications, showcasing several key aspects of web development.</p>
  <p>The application implements CRUD actions, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete their professional documents. This is a fundamental part of the application's interactivity and data management.</p>
  <p>For the backend, Profiler uses PostgreSQL, a robust and scalable open-source relational database. This choice ensures efficient handling and storage of user data, including personal documents and application details. An automated seed file is included to populate the database with initial data, crucial for consistent testing and demonstration purposes.</p>
  <p>In terms of architecture, Profiler separates concerns using models and controllers. Models handle the business logic and data interactions, while controllers manage the user interface and application flow, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.</p>
  <p>A unique feature of Profiler is a download functionality, allowing users to easily download their documents. The application also includes date interactions, enabling users to input and manage dates related to their applications or professional milestones.</p>
  <p>The front-end of Profiler is marked by the use of shared components, promoting reusability and consistency across the application. HTML and CSS are utilized for structuring and styling the application, with special attention to the home page to enhance user experience.</p>
  <p>CSS is extensively used for styling, ensuring that the application is not only functional but also visually appealing and user-friendly. This includes responsive design elements to accommodate various device sizes.</p>
  <p>Overall, Profiler serves as a comprehensive example of web development using Ruby on Rails, covering everything from database management and MVC architecture to user interface design and shared component utilization.</p>
